# Conway's-Game-Of-Life 

### Computer Science - Unit 1 Build Week Project 
```
This application is an implementation of John Conway's, Game of Life, that he discovered in 1970. 

```
## Built using: 
> - JavaScript
> - React.js

### Rules: 
```
These are the rules required for Game of Life.

```
> 1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.

> 2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.

> 3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.

> 4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

### About the Algorithm: 

> - Conway's Game of Life was first developed by a British mathematican, John Conway, in 1970.
The game consists of being in either two states, alive(on) or dead(off). The patterns on the game evolve over time and the cells move across the grid, making this a "zero-player" game and Turing complete.
